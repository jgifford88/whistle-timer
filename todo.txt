Goal: Spin up a Stopwatch React.js app with the following features/requirements

Functionality:

- Displays elapsed time digitally, starting at 00:00
- A start/stop button (should be ‘start’ if the watch isn’t running and vice versa)
- A reset button (turns to 00:00 and does not change the running state of the watch)
- A “Lap” button (records time elapsed since the last press of the button, or since 00:00)
- A scrollable list of all laps recorded since the last “reset”

Style:

- Clock should be centered at the top of the page
- All buttons should be centered underneath the clock
- The list of laps should be somewhere on the right side of the screen (doesn’t matter if the list overflows and causes the page to grow infinitely).

Misc:

When finished, let’s jump on a screenshare so we can see a demo!
In other words, don’t worry about hosting.
